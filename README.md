# COMP273 : Introduction to Computer Systems
This is a repository for COMP273 assignments and projects taken at McGill University.

# Table of contents
1. Assignment 1
    * [Sequential Multiplier](./Asgn1/SequentialMultiplier.circ) : this circuit performs binary multiplication. It makes use of a combination of __registers, adders, selectors and D flip-flops__.
    * [Sequential Divider](./Asgn1/SequentialDivider.circ) : this circuit performs binary division and makes use of __registers, shift registers, substrators, multiplexors, selectors and D flip-flops__.
2. Assignment 2
    * [Vignere Cipher](./Asgn2/cipher.asm) : This code implements 3 functions, one to encrypt a particular message; one to decrypt; and one to guess the key of an encoded message by computing the letter frequencies. More on the Vignere Cipher [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher).
4. Assignment 3
    * [Matrix multiplication](./Asgn3/matrix-multiplication.asm) : Perform multiplication of 2 square (n x n) matrices of single precision floating point numbers. It also performs matrix subtraction and calculates the Frobeneous Norm.
